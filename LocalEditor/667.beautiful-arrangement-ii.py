question_content="""Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n different
positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following
requirement:


Suppose this list is answer =Â [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 -
a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct
integers.


Return the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of
them.


Example 1:


Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1
to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1


Example 2:


Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1
to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.



Constraints:


1 <= k < n <= 10^4
