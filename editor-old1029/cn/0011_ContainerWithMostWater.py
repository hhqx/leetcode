You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines 
drawn such that the two endpoints of the i·µó ∞ line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). 

 Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the 
container contains the most water. 

 Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. 

 Notice that you may not slant the container. 

 
 Example 1: 
 
 
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,
7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can 
contain is 49.
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 n == height.length 
 2 <= n <= 10‚Åµ 
 0 <= height[i] <= 10‚Å¥
