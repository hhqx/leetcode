You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work 
on the i·µó ∞ job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i). 

 You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job 
schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day 
is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day. 

 You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty 
of the i·µó ∞ job is jobDifficulty[i]. 

 Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule 
for the jobs return -1. 

 
 Example 1: 
 
 
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you 
cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
 

 Example 3: 

 
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300 
 0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000 
 1 <= d <= 10
