question_content = """
Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that 
are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'. 

 A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region. 


 
 Example 1: 
 
 
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O",
"X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]
]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 m == board.length 
 n == board[i].length 
 1 <= m, n <= 200 
 board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
