question_content = """
Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. 
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7. A 
subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string 
by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the 
relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., 
"ace" is a subsequence of 
"abcde" while 
"aec" is not. 
 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", 
and "abc".
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and 
"aba".
 

 Example 3: 

 
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= s.length <= 2000 
 s consists of lowercase English letters.
